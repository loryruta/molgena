# bioinfo project

Project developed for the exam of the course AI for Bioinformatics.

### Chemical properties to optimize:

- logp (Octanol-water Partition Coefficient): measures the solubility and synthetic accessibility of a compound 
- QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness)
- SA (Synthetic Accessibility): how hard/easy is to synthetize the molecule
- MW (Molecular Weight)

### Metrics

- Frechet ChemNet Distance (FCD, used in MoLeR): measure how much realistic are generated molecules
- Tanimoto similarity coefficient ([Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)): used to measure [similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_similarity) between two molecules

### You might don't know that...

- Molecular fingerprint: encode properties of small molecules and assess their similarities computationally through bit string comparisons
